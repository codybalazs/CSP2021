	<h1> 1.1.9 Project </h1>
    <center><img src="images/project.JPG" height="350"></center>
	<p> My project uses the python turtle module to draw a solar system with the sun, stars, and planets. </p>
	<p> The planets orbit around the sun, and a moon orbits around one of the planets. I used several different commands and loops to achieve my goal. </p>
	<h1> 1.2.5 Project </h1>

	<p> The purpose of my game is to have the turtle on the screen move around and collect as many coins as possible before the timer runs out.</p>
	<p> The turtle can be moved around the screen using the arrow keys. There is a timer that counts down the time and a scoreboard that keeps track of how many coins are collected. </p>
	<h1> 1.1.3 Project </h1>

	<p> Our project is an interactive game. When you start the game, you are in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. You have to make several choices during the game to try and survive. </p>
	<p> If you make all of the right choices, you will win the game. However, if you make a wrong choice, you will be caught by the zombies and lose. </p>
	<h1> Scratch Project </h1>
	<center><img src="images/scratch project.JPG" height="350"></center>
	<p> Our project is a parkour game. The goal of the game is to reach the green flag without touching the red areas. There are several levels that you can play. </p>
	<p> You can make the character jump and move left and right using the arrow keys. The black surfaces are safe, the red surfaces are lava, and you can stick to the orange surfaces.</p>
